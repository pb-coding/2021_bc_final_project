# 2021_bc_final_project
Final project for my business coding classes:

This is a price comparison program for user selected gas stations based on data of the clever-tanken.de website.
Gas station specific links can be stored in the gas_stations.txt file - only clever-tanken.de links are supportet.
For the moment the tool only supports comparing diesel gas prices.
