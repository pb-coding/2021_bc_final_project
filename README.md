# 2021_bc_final_project
Final project for my business coding classes:

This is a gas price comparison program for user selected gas stations based on extracted data of the clever-tanken.de website.
Gas station specific links can be stored in the gas_stations.txt file - only clever-tanken.de links are supportet.

Implemented features:
* 'list' - to display all gas stations with the corresponding diesel prices
* 'cheapest' - to display only the cheapest one
* more features coming soon..

Actually you could use the "add to favorite" feature of clever-tanken.de for that, but I wanted to build such kind of a feature on my own as a challenge.
For the moment the tool only supports comparing diesel gas prices.
